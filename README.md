# production.plugin.js
The plugin handles console.logs based on Cookie variable. 

## How to use

 - add this script `<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/aleksanderem/production.plugin.js/production.plugin.min.js"></script>` to the `<head>` section as close the top as you can
 - in default, you will see no console.log / warn / info right after you paste it
 - if you need to see console information, add a cookie named `debugJS` and set value `true`
 - if you need to preview what happens in console **without** adding the Cookie, go to dev tools ( in Chrome ), console, and write `console.logArray` ( screenshot : http://prntscr.com/mqat0j )
